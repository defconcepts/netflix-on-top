Sometimes I like to watch movies while I work, and I always need to either put it on another screen, watch it on a different device, or reposition my windows that makes my code spagetti.

Netflix On Top allows you to watch netflix movies while you work and browse, A node-webkit application that simply frames netflix in a always on top window. 

This app is no way associated with netflix or affliates, this is simply a iframe.
